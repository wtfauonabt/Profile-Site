A Curriculum Vita web-site.
    The web-site is one paged.
    It can store:
        Personal information (Profile, Skills, Experience)
        Portfolio
        Contact Section

    A form is presented in the contact section which allows
    information to be sent directly to user's email.

    The website is a produced from the bases of Bootstrap.
    Examples of Bootstrap usage was acquired from:
        http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/

    The web-site was created for my personal use.
    I would greatly appreciate if referencing was made to
